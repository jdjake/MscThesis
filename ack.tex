\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I am indepted to my advisors, Dr. Malabika Pramanik and Dr. Josh Zahl, for their key insights in the past two years of research. Their advice on conducting research will aid me for years to come. Without their tough scrutiny of my writing style over the past year in the writing of our recently submitted research paper, this thesis would be exponentially less legible.

I would also like to give credit to my unofficial undergraduate research advisor, Dr. Zachary Friggstad. Our long discussions have changed the way I think about mathematics, and I look forward to many more discussions when I visit Edmonton. Your influence is felt throughout the research I have conducted in the past two years.

It is important to acknowledge the University of British Columbia, and the NSERC research fund, for their financial support during my masters degree.

Thanks to my family for their support throughout my education. I would especially like to thank my grandfather, Ted Mcclung. Without your encouragement in my early years of undergraduate education, it is unlikely I would have found my passion for higher mathematics.

Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank the UBC mathematics department, and greater student community, for keeping me grounded during many stressful moments over the past two years of research.

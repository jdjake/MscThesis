\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my advisors, Dr. Malabika Pramanik and Dr. Josh Zahl for their key insights in the past two years of research. Without their tough scrutiny of my writing style over the past year in the writing of our recently submitted research paper, this thesis would be exponentially less legible.

I'd also like to thank the University of British Columbia and the NSERC research fund, for their financial support during the writing of the thesis.

Thank you to my `unofficial undergraduate research advisor', Dr. Zachary Friggstad. I can't state how much our long discussions in your office have changed the way I think about mathematics. Your influence is felt throughout the research detailed here.

I would also like to thank my family for their support. I would especially like to thank my grandfather, Ted Mcclung. Without your encouragement in my early years of undergraduate education, it is unlikely I would have found my passion for higher mathematics.

Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank the UBC mathematics department, and greater student community, for keeping me grounded during many stressful moments over the past two years of research. You know who you are.

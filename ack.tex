\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I am indepted to my advisors, Dr. Malabika Pramanik and Dr. Josh Zahl, for their key insights in the past two years of research. Their advice will help me conduct research for years to come. Without their tough scrutiny of my writing style over the past year, this thesis would be exponentially less legible.

I would also like to give credit to Dr. Zachary Friggstad. Our long discussions have changed the way I think about mathematics, and I look forward to many more. His influence is felt throughout the new techniques developed in this thesis.

Thanks to my family, for their support throughout my education. I would especially like to thank my grandfather, Ted McClung. Without your encouragement in my early years of undergraduate education, it is unlikely I would have found my passion for higher mathematics.

Finally, I'd like to thank the UBC mathematics department, and greater student community, for keeping me grounded during many stressful moments over the past two years.

% It is important to acknowledge the University of British Columbia, and the NSERC research fund, for their financial support during my masters degree.

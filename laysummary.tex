\chapter{Lay Summary}

%Imagine a patch of carpet under a microscope. Zooming in, we see the carpet is really a collection of twines tied together. On closer inspection, those twines break off into smaller tufts of fabric. The carpet is rough at all scales. Shapes like circles or polygons do not have complexity at arbitrarily small scales. To model the roughness of a carpet, you'd need a fractal: a shape with complex structure at all small scales. Such models are often useful in small-scale physics or computer graphics.

%It is easy to construct polyhedra with geometric properties at a single scale. But it is non-trivial to construct fractals with properties at many scales. For instance, how do we construct a fractal which intersects any line in at most two points? In this thesis, we begin with an exposition on previous constructions in the literature, and then provide new construction techniques utilizing randomness.

Geometers are often interested in constructing shapes satisfying certain properties. For instance, given three points, can one find a circle connecting them? Most questions of this type involving shapes like circles or polygons have been answered. But many open questions remain about more modern families of shapes. Here, we focus on \emph{fractals}, a class of shapes whose most well known representatives include the Koch snowflake and the Sierpinski triangle. Fractals often occur in applications such as small scale physics and computer graphics.

This thesis focuses on constructing \emph{large} fractals which avoid the existence of certain configurations. For example, can one construct a large fractal so that one cannot form an equilateral triangle from three points contained on the fractal? We begin with an exposition of some previous results of this type which have been achieved in the literature, and then provide new construction techniques utilizing a novel random approach.

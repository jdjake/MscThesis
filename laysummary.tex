\chapter{Lay Summary}

%Imagine a patch of carpet under a microscope. Zooming in, we see the carpet is really a collection of twines tied together. On closer inspection, those twines break off into smaller tufts of fabric. The carpet is rough at all scales. Shapes like circles or polygons do not have complexity at arbitrarily small scales. To model the roughness of a carpet, you'd need a fractal: a shape with complex structure at all small scales. Such models are often useful in small-scale physics or computer graphics.

%It is easy to construct polyhedra with geometric properties at a single scale. But it is non-trivial to construct fractals with properties at many scales. For instance, how do we construct a fractal which intersects any line in at most two points? In this thesis, we begin with an exposition on previous constructions in the literature, and then provide new construction techniques utilizing randomness.

In geometry, we are often interested in constructing shapes with certain properties. For instance, given three points, can one find a circle connecting these three points? Most questions of this type involving classical shapes like circles and polygons have been answered. But many open questions remain about more modern families of shapes. Here, we focus on \emph{fractals}; Examples of fractals include the Koch snowflake and Sierpinski triangle. This class of shapes often occurs in small scale physics and computer graphics.

In this thesis, we focus on constructing large fractals which avoid the existence of certain configurations. For example, can one construct a large fractal so that one cannot form an equilateral triangle from three points lying on the fractal? We begin with an exposition on constructions in the literature for avoiding configurations, and then provide new construction techniques utilizing randomness.

\chapter{Preface}

This thesis gives an exposition by the author, of the pattern avoidance problem and the geometric measure theory required to understand the pattern avoidance problem in the non-discrete setting. In Chapter \ref{ch:RoughSets}, the author presents details of joint work with his supervisors Dr. Joshua Zahl and Dr. Malabika Pramanik. The results of that section have been submitted for publication in the Springer Series \emph{Harmonic Analysis and Applications}. In Chapter \ref{ch:Conclusions}, the author presents details on partially completed results, which he hopes can be refined and published in the near future.

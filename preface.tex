\chapter{Preface}

This thesis gives an exposition by the author, of the pattern avoidance problem and the geometric measure theory required to understand the pattern avoidance problem in the non-discrete setting. In Chapter \ref{ch:RoughSets} and \ref{ch:Applications}, the author presents details of joint work with his supervisors Dr. Joshua Zahl and Dr. Malabika Pramanik. The results of these sections have been accepted for publication in the Springer series \emph{Harmonic Analysis and Applications}. As is the norm in mathematical research, all researchers are assumed to have contributed equally to these results. But to list concrete contributions, the author of this thesis reviewed the background literature detailed in the bibliography to this paper, and came up with the main problem statement behind Theorem \ref{mainTheorem}. In Chapter \ref{ch:Conclusions}, the author presents details on partially completed results emerging from discussions with Dr. Joshua Zahl and Dr. Malabika Pramanik, which he hopes can be refined and published in the near future.

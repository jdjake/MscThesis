\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

In this thesis, we study a simple family of questions:
%
\begin{center}
	{\it How large can Euclidean sets be not containing geometric patterns?}.
\end{center}
%
For instance, what is the maximal size of a set $X \subset \RR^d$ that contains no three collinear points? Or what is the maximal size of a set not containing the vertices of an isosceles triangle? Aside from pure geometric interest, these problems provide useful settings to test methods of ergodic theory, additive combinatorics and harmonic analysis.

Sets which avoid the patterns we consider are highly irregular, in many ways behaving like a fractal set. Our understanding of them requires techniques from geometric measure theory. In particular, we use the \emph{fractal dimension} to measure the size of a set when determining how large a pattern avoiding set can be.

%The Lebesgue density theory shows any subset of $\RR^d$ with positive measure must contain a copy of the vertices of any suitably small isosceles triangle. Similar techniques show sets avoiding any of the patterns considered in this thesis must have measure zero. Thus non-trivial pattern avoiding sets must be highly irregular, and require techniques from geometric measure theory to be understood.

%In particular, the Lebesgue measure cannot quantify the `maximal size' of a pattern avoiding set. Thus a `second-order' quantification of the size of a measure zero must be introduced, and this is satisfied by the fractional dimension of a set, first introduced by Felix Hausdorff in 1918. We shall take the Hausdorff dimension he introduced as a primary measure of a set's size.%, as well as various other more modern notions of fractional dimension which give more structural information about a set.

At present, many fundamental questions about geometric structure and it's relation to fractal dimension remain unsolved. One might expect sets with sufficiently large fractal dimension contain patterns. For example, Theorem 6.8 of \cite{Matilla} shows that any set $X \subset \RR^d$ with Hausdorff dimension exceeding one must contain three collinear points. On the other hand, Theorem 2.3 of \cite{Maga} constructs a set $X \subset \RR^d$ with full Hausdorff dimension such that no four points in $X$ form the vertices of a parallelogram. Thus the problem depends on the particular aspects of the configurations involved. For most geometric configurations, it remains unknown at what threshold patterns are guaranteed, or whether such a threshold exists at all. So finding sets with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding patterns is an important topic to determine for which classes of patterns our intuition remains true.

Our goal in this thesis is to derive new methods for constructing sets avoiding patterns. In particular, we expand on a number of general {\it pattern dissection methods} which have proven useful in the area, originally developed by Keleti but also studied notably by Math\'{e}, Pramanik, and Fraser. The main contribution we give to pattern dissection methods is to use random dissections to avoid patterns which lack structural information. Thus we can expand the utility of interval dissection methods from regular families of patterns to a set of {\it fractal avoidance problems}, that previous methods were completely unavailable to address. Such problems include finding large $X$ such that the angles formed by any three distinct points of $X$ avoid a specified set $Y$ of angles, where $Y$ has a fixed fractal dimension.
